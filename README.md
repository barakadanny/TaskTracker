# TaskTracker

TaskTracker is a simple, category-based task management application built using **ReactJS**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. It allows users to create categories, add tasks to those categories, and manage tasks by marking them as complete or deleting them.

## Features

- **Add Categories**: Users can create categories for organizing their tasks.
- **Add Tasks**: Tasks can only be added under a category.
- **Task Management**: Users can mark tasks as complete or delete them.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks and categories are saved locally, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and cleaner code.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design.
